## Introduction
In this project we are going to demonstrate the possibility to control an LCD interfaced with R5 processor from Linux running on A53 Processor on a Xilinx Ultrascale+ device.

We are Using TE0802 Ultrascale+ Board by Trenz Electronics.
We will interface the LCD Touch screen with R5 Processor
We Will install Linux on A53 Processor
Using Memory Mapped Commumication, We Will create a communication channel between the two processors
And We will interact with the drivers of the LCD from the linux through the Memory mapped channel
